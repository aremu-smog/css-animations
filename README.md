# css-animations

A repo to relearn css animation.

Each section contains an `html`,`css` and `note.md` file

The `html` and `css` files are simply to practice as I follow along and therefore may not contain all learnings

The `note.md` is basically my `jottings`.

Basically, I am saying this repo is not a great way to learn about CSS animations. Consider purchasing the Udemy course [here](https://www.udemy.com/share/1020su3@mGBj5dK1T6AP4Za3-AA1rKZpeikmqBR_0SAulIl_jBhj9k8ZpAEKej8rPpsb7Csg/)
